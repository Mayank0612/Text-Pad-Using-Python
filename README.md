# Text-Pad-Using-Python
Text Pad works similar to notepad but I have added some extra features which I think that notepad should have in it. And these are:

 1) Changing the font color
 2) Speech to text converter
 3) English to Hindi translator
 4) Inbuilt Emoji features to express users emotions
 5) Changing the background color according to the user comfort
 6) Displaying day,date and time whenever user opens the text pad
 
 Before running python file please one time go through the module I have imported, so that if the particular module is not installed on your device you can download it 
 and run it in you device
